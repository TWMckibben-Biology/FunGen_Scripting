### 09-07-2021 Downloading Data; AC
Downloaded 10 samples using sratoolkit on EAS.Used the prefetch/dump combination code from the utility of blood transcriptome repo. 
FASTQ files were split and dumped in `/scratch/adc0032/DpulexCaloricWD/SRRs`using the script `download_SRA.sh` which can be found in 
`/home/adc0032/workflows`. I used the SRA_Acc_List.txt downloaded from SRA run selector on the web for this bioproject (insert id).

This script has no header, so it was called using my general job submisson script `gen_slurm_submit.sh` also in `~/workflows`.
One sample did not download through the first pass (SRR6819018), so I move it to a new input file (grep "SRR6819018" SRA_Acc_list.txt > redo_acc_list.txt),
and used that as input to `download_SRA.sh` on a second pass, with no issues. 

### 09-08-2021 Project Organization; AC
Created a github repository for this project. Gave it a general structure, but have not filled in many details. 
Added all of the scripts previously generated by past FunGen students onto EAS (`rsync`).
Mapped out the analysis pipeline, indicating if the scripts for each step were present or whether there needed to be any modifications.
[The analysis map](https://excalidraw.com/#json=6318931916619776,W88Xasevi5iT8um0p4cqJg) was generated with 
[Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com) and will be updated alongside this log. 

### 09-13-2021 Writing support scripts ; AC
revised `download_SRA_a.sh` to increase reproducibility. Organized for usage in an array or with the proper arguments at the command line. 

Generated support scripts for:

1. fastq file quality check `run_fastqc.sh`
2. trimming adaptors and low quality sequences `run_trimmomatic.sh`

### 09-14-2021 Meeting and requesting software; AC
Met with collaborators: requested github ids, code, and discussed adding new pipeline, salmon
requested software on easley: stringtie, gffread, kallisto
